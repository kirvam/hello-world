# hello-world
hello-world repo

This is a test run of GIT.
My goal is to practice so I can start to use the public GIT to manage all my important stuff:
1.  Like perl scripts
2.  bash scripts
3.  howto documentation
4.  organizational design documents
5.  html code templates
6.  css code templates
7.  other code
